= Jenkins Pipeline Workshop

== Workshop #2 - Pipeline As Code

=== GitHub Credentials

Go back to your Jenkins, let's now add your GitHub credentials.

* If you don't have one yet, generate an API token => Open https://github.com/settings/tokens

This token needs to have all permissions on `repo`, `admin:org` `admin:repo_hook` and `admin:org_hook`.

You will then use that token as a password alternative.

CAUTION: Attention, GitHub will not let you see the token again afterwards,
save it correctly somewhere.

* On your Jenkins instance, open http://<YOUR_IP>:8080/credentials/store/system/domain/_/

Add a credentials with your Github login, using the token previously generated as the password.

NOTE: For your information, you are the only one allowed to access your Jenkins instance, and the API token is encrypted on the disk.
However, it is obviously strongly recommended that you revoke that token at the end of the workshop.

=== Create a GitHub organization

* Open GitHub with your account, and create a new organization.
  Give it a the name you love :-).
* Fork the repo https://github.com/ToulouseJAM/spring-petclinic with your organization

=== Jenkinsification of the project

Let's now add a `Jenkinsfile` to your project.

* On your machine, clone the previously forked repo: git@github.com:${YOUR_ORGANIZATION}/spring-petclinic.git

* Create a `Jenkinsification` branch from the `master` one, and create a `Jenkinsfile` file at the root of your repo:

[source,bash]
$> git checkout -b Jenkinsification && touch Jenkinsfile

* Transform the _Scripted_ Pipeline created during the first part of the workshop, into a `Declarative Pipeline` one (must begin with `pipeline{ ... }`)

NOTE: To make your life easier, you can try to scaffold your Pipeline using the Blue Ocean Visual Editor. Follow instructions on http://${IP_JENKINS}:8080/blue/organizations/jenkins/create-pipeline
This project is still in early stages, though it's improving very quickly, so you could see some discrepancies

TIP: You should find the following helpful:

=== Syntax validation

Using link:https://jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/cli/#using-the-cli-client[documentation du CLI Jenkins], verify the syntax of your Jenkinsfile remotely.

To be able to connect to the Jenkins CLI, you will need to generate an SSH keypair, and add the public key in your user account in the typical way.
Cf. link:https://jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/cli/#authentication[https://jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/cli/#authentication]

NOTE: If you don't know what to do with the previous, please ask us! :-)

You should be able to run the following command (GitBash sur Windows) :

[source,bash]
$> java -jar cli.jar -i your_SSH_key -s http://${IP_JENKINS}:8080 declarative-linter --username ${YOUR_JENKINS_USER} --password ${YOUR_PASSWORD} < path/to/your/Jenkinsfile

Same command on Windows:

[source,bat]
cat .\Jenkinsfile | java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -i your_SSH_key -s http://${IP_JENKINS}:8080 declarative-linter

TIP: the CLI lets you do a big amount of things remotely.
Use the `help` command to output the exhaustive list of possible actions
(or use `http://${IP_JENKINS}:8080/cli`).

=== Create a GitHub Organization job

1. Once you've validated your Jenkinsfile, commit and push those modifications to your fork.
2. On Jenkins, create a new  `GitHub Organization` job and complete the configuration to point to your organization.
Select the credentials you created previously.
Using the default options for the rest should be enough.

Jenkins should now scan all the branches of all the repositories of your organization, looking for ``Jenkinsfile``s.
Then it will create and execute the associated jobs.

NOTE: When you have successfully ran a build, you may notice a sentence at the end of the build `GitHub has been notified of this commitâ€™s build result`.
On GitHub side, for each of your commit that are successful or failing, the build status will be shown next to it.

TIP: When in "development mode" for Jenkins Pipeline, it is generally recommended to now use the `Replay` feature to avoid having to commit & push to test changes.

=== Building binaries

Let's now fill in the last "holes" in our Pipeline so that it becomes at least  bit useful :-).

1. In the `build & unit tests` stage, configure your pipeline to run a Maven build.
There are many ways to achieve this, as always, we recommend using the `withMaven` step (see link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Maven+Plugin[doc])
2. In the `build & unit tests` stage, after the Maven build, add a step to `stash` the generated binaries `target/\*.jar`.
4. In the `staging` and `deploy` stages, add an `unstash` step for the binaries.
Make sure the binary is available in the workspace using `ls -l target` after the `unstash` call.
5. As Jenkins reuses workspaces by default when possible, it's recommended to always cleanup workspaces when using steps like `unstash` to make sure the workspace is clean each time and avoid issues.
So add that cleanup just before calling `unstash`.

NOTE: Use the link:https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/[Pipeline documentation] and the `Snippet Generator`.

=== Static code analysis

1. Open your SonarQube instance: the default credentials are admin/admin. Change directly the admin password.
2. Generate a SonarQube API token in the Security part in the options of the admin user: see link:http://${IP_SONARQUBE}:9000/account/security/[http://${IP_SONARQUBE}:9000/account/security/]
3. In the global configuration of Jenkins, configure the informations to access your SonarQube instance.
4. Improve the `static-analysis` stage to allow a SonarQube analysis (see `withSonarQubeEnv` step => link:https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner+for+Jenkins[documentation])

Re-run your Pipeline, you should now see the SonarQube icon next to your build.
Open SonarQube and check the analysis went fine.

=== Restrict deploys to master branch only

As we generally work with many branches with Git, it can be complex to manage many deployments of different versions of our applications to different deployment environment.
To keep things simple, hence we're going to restrict deploys to the `master` branch only.

1. Using the link:https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/[Pipeline documenration], adjust things so that the `staging`, `manual-approval` and `deploy` stages trigger only when the current branch is `master`.
2. Push your modifications to the `Jenkinsification` branch and observe how it goes.
The `staging`, `manual-approval` and `deploy` stages should be shown as _skipped_
3. Merge now the `Jenkinsification` branch on `master`, push your modifications and have a look at the build.
The deployment steps should now be enabled.
